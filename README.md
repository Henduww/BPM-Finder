# BPM Finder
An application with a sweet and simple UI that allows you to find the tempo of a song with ease.

## Downloading and running
To download the program, simply head to the *"Releases"* tab to download and run the executable file (**BPM Finder.exe**).

No installation is required, and the program can be executed immediately after installing.

## How to use the BPM finder
Once the application is opened, tap any key on your keyboard to the tempo of any song.
This will calculate both the average tempo in which you are tapping, as well as the nearest whole BPM.

## Heavily based on Richard T. Reels web tool
The idea for this program was based on Richard T. Reels [web tool at all8.com](https://www.all8.com/tools/bpm.htm).

All source code is written in an entirely different languages and is designed and written only by me.
